Start by downloading all the files in the Project4 folder (P4initUpdated, raceStat, genTrack, FinalRaceNoVisual, FinalRacewithVisual, and the P4_Model_Final). Once that is complete, run the P4initUpdated file and
then either open the FinalRaceNoVisual (it will just output the required data) or FinalRacewithVisual (it will output the data with the track visual looping), depending on your preference. Once that is complete,
the results can be seen and the project is complete.
